#CS458 Final Project - Guess The Champion Game

##Description

This is a simple game made with the native UIKit in Swift.
This game is mainly for people who play the game League of Legends.
The goal is to select the correct option or type in the correct answer into the text box, depending on the difficulty you select.

There are no special dependancies or any additional set up work necessary to run this game.
Treat this like any of the other UIKit apps we've made this semester.

##Acknowledgements

Characters and original images were made by Riot Games.

250x250 images and silhouettes with clear backgrounds made by my lovely boyfriend [Tanner Clark](https://tclarkdesigner.myportfolio.com/about).

All coding was done by myself.
